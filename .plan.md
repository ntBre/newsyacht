These are a few loose notes on future work:

- [ ] Some kind of ranking/scoring system for an ordering other than
  reverse-chronological
- [x] Truncate the number of displayed posts, I think it will quickly grow out
  of hand if you subscribe to many feeds
- [x] Some kind of thumbnail/preview for posts that support it, especially
  YouTube videos
- [ ] Ways to select subsets of posts:
  - [x] By URL/feed
  - [ ] By topic/tag
  - [ ] Search
- [ ] Fetching posts in parallel

## Scoring

I have the basics of scoring working with a `Model` that can be stored in the
database, but I still need to wire it up with the rest of the program. The first
step is just to load a `Model` on startup (when running `update` and `serve` at
least)

### `update`

`update` needs the model to assign initial scores. I think for now I'll preserve
the batch weighting in `initial_score` as a multiplicative factor on the model's
score (i.e. `Model.score() * initial_score()`). I'm pretty sure this is a
read-only view of the model, we only add more data when one of the posts is
voted on.

### `serve`

Speaking of voting, `serve` also needs a `Model` because voting on a post needs
to update the model in the database. So the main task here is to add some kind
of UI for up- and down-votes, almost certainly small up and down arrows to the
left of the list entry.

I don't think the votes actually update the scores of the existing posts, as I
was initially picturing. Instead, votes only update the model itself, affecting
the predicted score of future posts.

## Thumbnails

Thinking about the voting arrows has also prompted me to consider a new layout
that would include thumbnails. I'm wondering if a table layout might be good here:

| Arrows | Post title | Thumbnail |
| Arrows | Post title | Thumbnail |
| Arrows | Post title | Thumbnail |
| Arrows | Post title | Thumbnail |
| Arrows | Post title | Thumbnail |

instead of the current bulleted list

I thought I was reimplementing old reddit, but apparently that puts the
thumbnail between the arrows and the post title instead. that also looks pretty
nice

After chatting with Codex, apparently using a list is the semantic HTML
approach, so I can stick with that. And I think I see why reddit puts the
thumbnail first, so that you can have a fixed width in the first two columns and
then a variable-length title.

I don't really love the stock icon for text posts, though.

If I want to add any sub-reddits to my feed again, they have a `media:thumbnail`
field I could save, just like YouTube.
