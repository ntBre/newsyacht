These are a few loose notes on future work:

- [ ] Some kind of ranking/scoring system for an ordering other than
  reverse-chronological
- [x] Truncate the number of displayed posts, I think it will quickly grow out
  of hand if you subscribe to many feeds
- [ ] Some kind of thumbnail/preview for posts that support it, especially
  YouTube videos
- [ ] Ways to select subsets of posts:
  - [x] By URL/feed
  - [ ] By topic/tag
  - [ ] Search
- [ ] Fetching posts in parallel
