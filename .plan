These are a few loose notes on future work:

- Some kind of ranking/scoring system for an ordering other than
  reverse-chronological
- Truncate the number of displayed posts, I think it will quickly grow out of
  hand if you subscribe to many feeds
- Some kind of thumbnail/preview for posts that support it, especially YouTube
  videos
- Ways to select subsets of posts:
  - By URL/feed
  - By topic/tag
  - Search
- Fetching posts in parallel
